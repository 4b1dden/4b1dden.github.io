    <h4>Scanning a QR code from a pdf on an iPhone is not that difficult.... or is it?</h4>
    <p>
      In the Netherlands, they have these gates at the stops of public transport. For the bigger stations, you need to check in / out in order for a small door to open. On the smaller ones, you just check in or out and the credit system makes appropriate changes.

      Now, I was arriving in Rotterdam to visit a friend. Rotterdam Centraal is a pretty big station and so I had to open these small doors by scanning my ticket. No biggie, right? There’s hundreds of people doing it every minute, and so should I be able to, too. Well, unfortunately, my ticket was in a pdf format on my phone. I open the file on my phone – with wired headphones in my ears still, so reaching in front of your pelvis is quite uncomfortable – and try to put the phone next to the small scanner, face down. 
      Nothing.
      Hm, that’s weird, let me try once again.
      Nothing.

      As I look onto my phone, the QR is sitting right there, on the screen, full brightness, in the middle, everything ready as it should. 
      People behind me were kinda confused, but as there’s more supply of these gates than demand at this particular afternoon time, I can afford to slow things down a bit and not form any line whatsoever. I try like that a couple of times before noticing that my phone vibrates slightly as I try to scan the QR code.

      What’s that? I wonder.
      In an awfully looking, uncomfortable position I try to see what’s happening with my phone as I twist in the way to see the phone screen from the bottom, my head approximately at a thigh level, looking like I am the Golden Ratio curve.

      Well, apparently, as I turn the phone around and put it closer to the scanning device, the Apple Pay dialogue with my credit card at the top shows up. Apparently, the iPhone has evaluated that there’s some sort of NFC reader in close proximity, and, combined with my motion of turning the phone around as if I were to pay with it, it tries to outsmart me by loading up the Wallet interface.

      Great. Now that we’ve discovered the bug, we can go on and fix it. It should be pretty simple to find this functionality in the setting and turn it off… right?

      Well, as I am learning French right now, my phone happens to be in French, too. Now, I can make some changes to settings as I know some words already. Looking for “wallet”, ‘Apple Pay’ or similar terms and going through their respective settings did not yield the desired outcome. After a couple of minutes of trying I decided to give up. Mind you, I’ve just wanted to pass through a gate at a train station, something that should take little to no cognitive effort by design and i've been here for close to 10 mintues now :P
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the obvious solution to this problem was what I ended up doing: wait for somebody to open the gate and sneak with them as if I were riding the train without a ticket :)
