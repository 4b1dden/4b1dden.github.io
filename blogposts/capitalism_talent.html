<h3>capitalism is horrible at allocating talent</h3>


<div class="posts">
  <div class="example">
    <p>
      a) greedy at core 
    </p>

    <p>
      b) unfortunately, a lot of hard problems are in this area. it's kind of an intellectual snowball really. 
      potentially boundless optimization ceiling & exponentially increasing funds => more talent acquisition and optimization. its a recursive definiton.
    </p>

    <p>
      c) where would these people go otherwise?
      is it actually increasing the subjective, individual utility?
    </p>
 
    <p>
      smartest people go to two places: where the money is & where the interesting problems are.
      unfortunately, the world of (crypto) trading offers both. 
      still as a crypto-skeptic (see articles linked in my 'articles' page, i really despise the concept), these two claims are almost non-debatable.
      i'm sure a lot of non-tech crypto-skeptics would immediately jump to argue the second claim. definitely from a moral / sustainability / societal perspective, all of which are completely valid.
      however, we might have forgotten about the challenges employees face here: 
      the no-ceiling optimization comptetition-based problems that are present.
      we are forgetting about the fact that the vast majority of target group we are talking about here have actually been in a similar environments for years now. working on slightly different problems to say the least. but even those problems are not as different as they might seem to an outsider.
    </p>

   

    IMO, IOI & similar type of people have been competing in problem-solving for years now. if, to this equation, one adds teams, collaboration, amazing compensation and benefits, we should not be surprised why they choose this route.

    we are expecting a level of moral responsibility from people we wouldn't uphold ourselves. 



    <p>potential solutions / paths:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        1. make money & then make risks?
      </li>
      <li>
        2. is this partially a case for UBI? 
      </li>
      <li>
        3. invest in academia & research 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>and how do i view it from my perspective?</p>
