<h4>forget starting phrases, numbers and introductions</h4>
<h5>you can learn those later...</h5>

<p>
  step 1: get a list of most commonly used words; 300 / 500 / 1000 / 5000 / ... 
  i recommend at least 500
</p>

<p>
  step 1.1: do the same with verbs. maybe take like 30-40 most used. there will naturally be some verbs you'll already know
  from step 1; but generally, this helps a lot, as recognizing verbs gives us a lot of utility in language comprehension and often
  helps us guess what other words in the sentence mean, especially nouns, as these tightly tied with verbs semantically. here, one 
  should also learn the basic conjugation. for now, i'd say the present simple and its equivalents are enough, but learning
  a past simple and equivalents might work too if it's simple enough (e.g. adding -ed to the end of a word). i wouldn't worry
  too much about irregular conjugations too much now – for the big big verbs, such as "want" / "have" / "be" / ... we need to 
  learn them by heart, but all the others are kind of unnecessary at this point. focus on the regularities.  
</p>

<p>
  step 2: learn those. i recommend using flashcards. for this, i found memrise.com to be extremely useful. oftentimes, the 
  "most commonly used words" pack will already be premade. it was for french for instance. the scheduling is up to each 
  of us, but i would just spend 10-15 minutes every evening typing out the words on memrise. they have multiple modes: i would 
  combine learning new with quick and long recaps. also, i'd write all the new words down to a notebook, so i can sometimes study offline
  i did not use this often, however, i believe writing stuff down helps you remember – plus it was a nice different activity to do.
  this may take you from a week to a couple of months, depending on your goal. after learning N words (realistically N >= 350), i'd slowly proceed to the next step.   
</p>

<p>
  step 3: starting interacting with the language in a spoken word form. here we will be getting better at two things: spoken word comprehension as well as vocabulary. for this, there's multiple ways:
  
  <br /> a) go to the country: lol kind of self-explanatory. prepare to not understand a lot. that's why i maybe should've started wih b) :P
  <br /> b) start watching youtube videos: there's a lot of youtubers who speak slowly and provide a very good language-learning content.
  for french i really like Piece of French for instance. there usually are subtitles in languageX and English that you can choose from.
  a thing i found useful was to download a chrome extension that enabled me to see subtitles in two languages at once. this really really helps. also, it does
  not really feel like labour and it can oftentimes even be fun. 
  <br /> c) listen to podcasts, music, ebooks, etc
  <br />
  
</p>

<p>
  step 4:
  we probably want to learn phrases, numbers and et cetera somewhere along the line, too. do this as you find appropriate, sometime during step 3 i'd say. but do not 
  invest too much time into it.
</p>

<p>
  step 5:
  start transcribing shit. 
</p>

<p>
  random tips / exercises:
  <ul>
    <li>
      take a short (5-10 mins) recording of a native person speaking. could be somebody reading the news, somebody telling a telling a story, reading from a book, etc. as they are talking, transcribe what they are saying, word for word. you will find that you need to stop the recording after each sentence, or rewind and listen to the same clip several times, or look up words you didn't know. it's a really great exercise and helps atune your ear to the accent, and separate the words from each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      get a chrome extension that lets you see subtitles in two languages at once. use that when watching videos mentioned in step 2.
    </li>
    <li>
      get some friends who natively speak the language: for this, Tandem is a great app that matches you with people based on the languages you speak fluently and a language you're trying to learn. you'll be kinda forced to speak / write on your own, which always helps
