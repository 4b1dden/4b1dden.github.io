      there's just way too many issues, I might separate these into separate blogposts.

      FYI, I consider myself open-minded. 
      I believe there's certain benefits to decentralization, and if the bLoCkChAiN technology is the means to do that, so be it, but I have yet to see a successful implementation that would solve an actual, existing problem.  
      In the current status quo, none of the current major implementations don't really make any sense: there's very few, if any, benefits and a fuckton of negatives, so let's get into it.
