      regarding professional experience: even though i kinda despise the platform, for the most comprehensive overview just check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristiancabala/">linkedin</a> <br>
      how people present themselves there is no good. but as a database of one's previous professional experience? does its job pretty well i'd say.
